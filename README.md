# chess
This is a chess game that I started writing in the middle of my first CS class. There are some obvious flaws in this game, namely the lack of classes. This is because at the time of writing this, I didn't know about classes. It made it much more of a challenge to write and the code looks much sloppier.

I present this not as an example of good coding practice but to demonstrate a willingness to take on large projects regardless of my experience.

The user experience is a little clunky. The human is always white because of how it is set up, though one could alter the code slightly to change this, but even then the human's side would be opposite the expected orientation. To make a move, click on the square of the piece you want to move and then click on the square you wish to move to. Then (due to some inexperience with GUIs) you must exit out of the GUI window in order for the computer to make its move. Once it has done so, the window will re-appear with both moves made. If you click on a square and then realize you don't wish to move that piece, simply re-click that same square.

The game features all of the traditional rules of the game as I understand them including en passant, castling, and promotion.
